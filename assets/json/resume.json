The approach applies condition-based statistical analysis to voltage and current behavior under charge, discharge, and idle states, enabling early detection of degradation trends beyond conventional real-time threshold methods. The system also considers integration with IEC 61850, a communication standard that supports standardized and interoperable data exchange among power and energy system devices, thereby enhancing system-level monitoring, safety, and battery lifecycle management.","highlights":["Condition-based degradation detection using charge, discharge, and idle operational states","Statistical histogram analysis of voltage deviation and cell position over long-term operation","Multi-level degradation diagnosis (Interest, Caution, Alarm, Fault)","Early fault prediction and fire-risk prevention for large-scale ESS","Support for battery lifetime management and recycling screening"],"startDate":"2018-01-02","endDate":"2018-11-02","url":"https://doi.org/10.8080/1020180120443"}]}
